## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Danilo Ramos, but you can call me Don!

ðŸ”§ **About Me**  
Iâ€™m a Senior Software Engineer with over 9 years of experience in backend development. I specialize in Kotlin, Python, microservices, event-driven architectures, and scalable system design. Iâ€™ve worked in high-growth startups, unicorns, and now in a large, privately held edtech company, contributing to impactful projects across logistics, finance, healthtech, and education.

I believe in understanding the problem before writing code. Iâ€™m passionate about building maintainable systems, mentoring teammates, and improving engineering culture. Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve introduced architectural improvements, helped junior developers ramp up quickly, and created tools that streamlined operations for multiple teams.
